## Introduction
Give agents permission to pay with a user's card through Crossmint's Agentic Payments API. This quickstart demonstrates the full flow from user authentication to granting scoped card permissions with spending rules — for both human users and AI agents.

**Learn how to:**
- Authenticate a user via Stytch (Google OAuth)
- Create an agent to manage card payments
- Save a payment method via Crossmint's embedded UI
- Verify a card for agent-initiated payments with passkey verification
- Give card permissions with per-transaction, daily, and monthly spending rules
- Retrieve secure card numbers (card number, expiration, CVC)

## Deploy
Easily deploy the template to Vercel with the button below. You will need to set the required environment variables in the Vercel dashboard.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FCrossmint%2Fcard-permissions-quickstart&env=NEXT_PUBLIC_STYTCH_PUBLIC_TOKEN,NEXT_PUBLIC_CROSSMINT_CLIENT_API_KEY)

## Setup
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Crossmint/card-permissions-quickstart.git && cd card-permissions-quickstart
```

2. Install all dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

3. Set up the environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

4. Get a Crossmint client API key from [here](https://docs.crossmint.com/introduction/platform/api-keys/client-side) and a Stytch public token from the [Stytch dashboard](https://stytch.com/dashboard), then add them to the `.env.local` file:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_STYTCH_PUBLIC_TOKEN=your_stytch_public_token
NEXT_PUBLIC_CROSSMINT_CLIENT_API_KEY=your_crossmint_client_api_key
```

5. Configure Stytch redirect URLs:

   In your [Stytch dashboard](https://stytch.com/dashboard/redirect-urls), add `http://localhost:3000/login` as a redirect URL for both **Login** and **Signup** under OAuth.

6. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

## Using in production
1. Create a [production API key](https://docs.crossmint.com/introduction/platform/api-keys/client-side).

## DoorDash browser-agent spike

`scripts/doordash-spike.ts` is a standalone Playwright proof that an automated
agent driving a **real, logged-in browser** can manipulate a DoorDash cart. It is
not the production agent — it validates the riskiest assumption before the full
build. There is no official consumer-ordering DoorDash API, so this drives the
real site via a persistent browser profile (no password is ever stored; you log
in manually once and the session persists in `.playwright-profile/`, which is
gitignored).

### Setup

```bash
pnpm install                                  # installs playwright + tsx (already in devDeps)
pnpm exec playwright install chromium         # one-time: download the browser binary
```

### Run

```bash
pnpm spike:doordash
# or with a specific store:
DOORDASH_STORE_URL=https://www.doordash.com/store/… pnpm spike:doordash
```

On the first run a headed Chromium opens — **log in to DoorDash manually once**.
The script then navigates to the store, adds the first menu item to the cart, and
advances through checkout to the **payment step** (it stops there; no card is
filled and no order is submitted). Screenshots are written to
`scripts/.spike-shots/` at each stage. On subsequent runs the saved session means
you start already logged in.

> DoorDash's DOM changes frequently, so the role/text selectors in the script may
> need tuning on the first run — the console logs and screenshots pinpoint where.
